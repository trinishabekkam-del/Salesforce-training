# Task 1 - Final Architecture Design

## Application Architecture

The system follows a layered architecture approach where each layer has a specific responsibility.

```text
User Interface (LWC)
        │
        ▼
Validation Rules
        │
        ▼
Record Triggered Flows
        │
        ▼
Apex Classes & Triggers
        │
        ▼
Salesforce Database
        │
        ▼
Reports & Dashboards
```

### Why this Architecture?

- Separates frontend and backend logic
- Improves maintainability
- Supports future scalability
- Follows enterprise application design principles

- Email
- Phone Number
- Experience

---

## Application Object

Stores application records submitted by applicants.

---

# Validation Rules

The following validation rules are implemented to ensure data quality.

## Applicant Email Validation

Purpose:

Prevent invalid email formats.

```formula
NOT(
CONTAINS(Email__c,"@")
)
```

Error Message:

```text
Please enter a valid email address.
```

---

## Experience Validation

Purpose:

Prevent negative experience values.

```formula
Experience__c < 0
```

Error Message:

```text
Experience cannot be negative.
```

---

# Formula Fields

## Applicant Score

Purpose:

Calculate a simple candidate score based on experience.

```formula
Experience__c * 10
```

Example:

- 2 Years Experience = 20 Score
- 5 Years Experience = 50 Score

---

# Flow Automation

## Applicant Registration Flow

### Flow Type

Record Triggered Flow

### Process

1. Applicant record is created.
2. System validates applicant information.
3. Application record is automatically generated.
4. HR receives notification.
5. Dashboard metrics are updated.

### Benefits

- Reduces manual work
- Improves efficiency
- Maintains data consistency

---

# Approval Process

## Candidate Selection Approval

The approval process ensures that selected candidates are reviewed before hiring.

### Approval Workflow

1. HR submits candidate profile.
2. Hiring Manager reviews application.
3. Manager approves or rejects candidate.
4. Applicant status is updated automatically.

### Approval States

- Pending
- Approved
- Rejected

---

# Apex Logic

## ApplicantController.cls

Purpose:

Handle custom business logic related to applicant validation.

```apex
public with sharing class ApplicantController {

    @AuraEnabled
    public static String validateApplicant(Integer exp){

        if(exp < 0){
            return 'Invalid Experience';
        }

        return 'Valid Applicant';
    }
}
```

### Why Apex?

Apex allows implementation of business requirements that cannot be achieved using standard Salesforce automation tools alone.

---

# Trigger Logic

## ApplicantTrigger

Purpose:

Prevent duplicate applicant records based on email address.

```apex
trigger ApplicantTrigger on Applicant__c (before insert) {

    Set<String> emails = new Set<String>();

    for(Applicant__c a : Trigger.new){
        emails.add(a.Email__c);
    }

    for(Applicant__c a : Trigger.new){
        if(emails.contains(a.Email__c)){
            a.addError('Duplicate Email Found');
        }
    }
}
```

### Business Value

- Prevents duplicate records
- Maintains clean data
- Improves reporting accuracy

# Task 5 - Reflection

Throughout this Salesforce Summer Program, I learned how enterprise applications are designed using multiple layers such as frontend, backend, automation, security, and analytics.

This project helped me understand how Salesforce technologies including Objects, Relationships, Validation Rules, Flows, Approval Processes, Apex, Triggers, Reports, Dashboards, and Lightning Web Components work together to create a complete business solution.

The most important takeaway from this project was learning to think beyond coding and start thinking like a Salesforce Solution Developer who considers scalability, security, maintainability, and user experience while designing applications.
